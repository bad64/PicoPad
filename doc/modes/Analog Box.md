# The one that started this mess in the first place

Analog mode was designed to allow usage of hall-effect levers with a full range of analog motion. It *might* work with potentiometer-based levers such as those from SJ@JX but to this day this remains untested; therefore, please assume a non-insignificant presence of dragons henceforth.

Plug the lever into the relevant header on the board, and you're basically set !
